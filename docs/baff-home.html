                <h1>Welcome to Baff</h1>
                <h3>Baff is an enterprise grade, integrated software framework that makes light work of business application 
                development by hiding technical complexity so that efforts are focused on delivering consistent business 
                functionality according to standard functional design patterns.</h3> 
                <h3>Baff is based on a modern software stack to deliver a rich, responsive user interface to web browsers
                    and mobile devices using HTML5 (based on Sencha Ext) and enterprise grade services (based on Spring Framework).</h3> 
                <h3>Because it is so quick to develop an end-to-end working solution, in the order of an hour or two for an
                activity based on one of the standard patterns, it is well suited for agile development as well as rapid 
                prototyping early in the delivery life-cycle, with the further advantage that the prototype can be extended 
                to develop the production solution.</h3>
